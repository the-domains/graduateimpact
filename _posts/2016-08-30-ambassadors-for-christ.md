## **AMBASSADORS FOR CHRIST**

Effective ambassadors needs to know 2 things: first they need to know the message of the king or government they represent, second they need to know how not to cause unnecessary offence in the culture they're in.

That's a great way to see ourselves when we're at work... No church minister will ever understand the culture or your workplace as well as you do. And likely none of your colleagues at work will understand the message of Jesus the King as well as you do.

When you go to work you are an ambassador for Christ to the people you work with! That means you have to know the message and know the culture.
