Biblenomics

### **21ST - 23RD OCTOBER 2016 // WOLTERSDORF, BERLIN**

## **What could the Bible possibly have to say to Economics and Finance?**

The financial crisis has been felt across the globe and has raised foundational questions about our economies and how we understand them. What, if anything, can Christians contribute at this crucial time? We welcome economics students and young professionals working in economics and finance from all over Europe and Eurasia to a unique conference on the Bible and economics: Biblenomics!
