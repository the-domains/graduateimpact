## **LIVING SIGNPOSTS**

All Christians all the time are saying something to someone by the way we live and the way we speak. Either we're saying Jesus makes all the difference in the world or else we're saying that he's irrelevant.

There's not time for Christians to be proclaiming Christ as Lord on Sunday and yet living as if he's meaningless from Monday to Friday.

**We want to help you learn to integrate what you say and what you do so that you feel confident speaking up for Jesus when your colleagues ask what you believe.**
