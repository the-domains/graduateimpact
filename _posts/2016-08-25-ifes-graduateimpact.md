## **IFES GRADUATEIMPACT**

GraduateImpact is a project of the International Fellowship of Evangelical Students (IFES), a global network of Christian ministries focussed on presenting the good news of Jesus Christ in students in every campus around the world. We operate in the IFES regions of Eurasia and Europe.

Our work focusses specifically on how we can best equip the emerging generation of young Christians to learn to integrate their passion for following Jesus into their working life after University.

We do this by training and mentoring, and below you can find links to our other dedicated websites.

Within this site you will find articles that may help you, and you will find ways to help us grow this strategic ministry.
