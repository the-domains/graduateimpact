# Cross-Current

## **CROSS-CURRENT PROFESSIONAL GROUPS**

Mentoring/discipleship groups focussed on a specific profession or academic field. So far we have run groups in the following areas: politics, economics, business, law and education. We plan in the near future to run new groups in Business, Science, Law, Medicine, Media, Sociology and Psychology.

These groups give a unique opportunity for young believers to benefit from the wisdom of older believers in the same profession. Each group meets twice a year for 3 years and grows together to understand how Christ's Lordship affects professional life.

## **CROSS-CURRENT CITY GROUPS**

Mentoring/discipleship groups based around a different city or country, pulling together graduates from different professions to learn life-long principles from the Bible that will help them live and speak for Jesus in their workplaces.

Like the Professional Groups these groups will meet twice a year for three years so that we can learn from each other and grow in our understanding of the way Jesus is with us in our workplace.

We are developing a brand new curriculum and resources to enable us to run Cross-Current City groups across the continent.

## Law

"Many people ask 'how can you possibly be a Christian and a lawyer?' Lawyers tend to be thought of as cold, analytical, and perhaps grasping, devious, not to be trusted. Perhaps not as far down the scale as bankers or estate agents but not far off. But actually the legal profession is an area that God is very interested in. In biblical thinking, justice is part of God's character and He provided a model of a legal system for His people. Justice will ultimately only be done when Christ comes again, but our job is to do it as well as it can be done here."

In Cross-Current we want to give you a biblical framework for understanding the place of believers in the legal world, the role of law in society, the nature of justice and fairness in God's sight. And we want to help you to tackle the structural issues in the profession in your country as you daily seek to live as Christ's agent of reconciliation in your world.
